 -----------------------------------------------------StalkEye - OSINT Intelligence Tool -----------------------------------------------------

StalkEye is a powerful Python-based OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed for ethical security research and digital footprint analysis. It automates the process of searching for a target username across the web using DuckDuckGo, then systematically scans the discovered URLs to extract valuable information such as email addresses, phone numbers, social media profiles, and more.


Disclaimer:
This tool is intended for authorized security assessments, educational purposes, and personal security awareness only. Misuse of this tool for unauthorized scanning, harassment, or any illegal activities is strictly prohibited.

Features :

o Search Automation: Automatically queries DuckDuckGo for a given username.
 
o Advanced Data Extraction: Parses web pages to find and extract:
	Email Addresses
 	Phone Numbers (International and local formats)
 	Social Media Profiles (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat)
 	Dates
 	Files (PDF, TXT, DOC, XLS, ZIP, RAR)

o Smart Filtering: Filters out ads and tracking domains to focus on relevant results.

o JSON Reporting: Saves all findings in a structured JSON file for further analysis.

o Stealthy Operation: Uses Playwright with a real Chrome user-agent for reliable scraping.

Ethical First: Includes a mandatory interactive disclaimer to ensure responsible use.
